Inspiration

Being a kinesthetic learner, I often find myself most invested when dealing with projects and other tangible activities. I decided to put my skills to the test and replicate a google search application as google is one of the most fundamental tools used in our modern world. 
Using a Google search api I found on https://rapidapi.com, I was able to create an application that searches the web to find practically anything you intend to look for.
