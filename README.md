Inspiration
Being a kinesthetic learner, I often find myself most invested when dealing with projects and other tangible activities. I decided to put my skills to the test and replicate a google search application as google is one of the most fundamental tools used in our modern world. 
Using a google search api I was able to create an application that searches the web to find practically anything you intend to look for.

Using my knowledge of React, Full-Stack Development, and Google Search API powered by https://rapidapi.com I've built a Google clone
